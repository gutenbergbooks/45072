      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE is one page
      of our own history that our historians pass over lightly and to which
      America cannot point with any feeling of pride, but only with shame and
      disgrace. I refer to the Mexican war. When the causes and results of that
      war are studied it can be readily understood why the Mexicans hate us and
      why the rest of the South American republics view us with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to the Mexican war the Nation was divided over the question of
      chattel slavery. That form of property had been abolished north of the
      Ohio river and Mason and Dixon line, but altho the South was still in the
      saddle, it felt that its seat was by no means secure. At that time the
      Nation consisted of 28 states, 14 of them free and 14 slave. States were
      admitted to the Union practically in pairs&mdash;one free and one slave
      state being admitted at the same time. This kept the United States Senate
      equally divided. But the more rapid growth of the population in the free
      states of the north threatened the political supremacy of the slave
      holding power. Wisconsin was applying for admission, and further west
      Minnesota, Dakota, Kansas and Nebraska loomed up as future free states.
      Louisiana, admitted in 1812, was the western limit of slave territory.
      Beyond Louisiana lay Mexico. Adventurers not only permitted, but
      encouraged by the slave power, entered Mexico and joined in a revolt
      against Mexico, and Texas was declared an independent state. Negotiations
      were immediately begun, looking to the annexation of Texas with the
      intention of dividing it into four states, and thus securing the South
      with a new lease of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon its admission a conflict with Mexico arose over its western boundary&mdash;Mexico
      claimed that the Nueces river was the dividing line, while the United
      States claimed the territory to the Rio Grande. This left a strip about
      150 miles wide as debatable ground. Here was a question that could easily
      have been settled by diplomacy and a treaty drawn up and the War of 1848
      prevented. But the American army invaded the disputed territory and was
      met by resistance by the Mexicans-a number were killed and wounded and the
      rest compelled to surrender. The war spirit always lying dormant in some
      people was lashed into a frenzy by such public declarations as "Our
      country has been invaded," "American blood has been spilled on American
      soil," all of which sounds strangely familiar to us today.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>eneral U. S. Grant
      was a soldier in the army at this time and it is pertinent at this point
      to quote the following extracts from his Personal Memoirs:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was no intimation that the removal of the troops to the border of
      Louisiana was occasioned in any way by the prospective annexation of
      Texas, but it was generally understood that such was the case. <i>Ostensibly</i>
      we were intended to prevent filibustering into Texas, but really as a
      menace to Mexico.... And to this day I regard the war which resulted as
      one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.
      It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European
      monarchies." (Vol. 1, Chapter III, page 53.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same people who, with permission of Mexico, had colonized Texas, and
      afterwards set up slavery there, and then seceded as soon as they felt
      strong enough to do so, offered themselves and the state to the United
      States, and in 1845 the offer was accepted. <i>The occupation, separation
      and annexation were, from the inception of the movement to its final
      consummation, a conspiracy to acquire territory out of which slave states
      may be formed for the American Union</i>. Even if the annexation itself
      could be justified, the manner in which the subsequent war <i>was forced
      upon Mexico cannot</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war. <i>Nations</i>,
      like individuals, are punished for their transgressions. We got our
      punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times."
      (Vol. 1, Chapter III, pages 54-56.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "The presence of United States troops on the edge of the disputed
      territory furthest from the Mexican settlements was not sufficient to
      provoke hostilities. <i>We were sent to provoke a fight</i>, but it was
      essential that Mexico should commence it. It was very doubtful whether
      congress would declare war, but if Mexico should attack our troops, the
      executive could announce: 'Whereas war exists, by the acts, etc.' and
      prosecute the contest with vigor." (Vol. 1, Chapter IV., page 68.)
    </p>
    <p>
      War was declared and it ended in the complete defeat of Mexico. And then
      the greed that incited the war gained full sway. The 150 miles of
      debatable ground, the dispute over which brought on the war, was lost
      sight of. Mexico, defeated and helpless, was forced to sign a treaty
      giving to the United States not only all of Texas, which in itself is as
      large as the whole German empire and New England together, but in
      addition, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Is
      it any wonder that the Mexicans hate us and call us "Pigs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present agitation in America for the invasion of Mexico, ostensibly
      for the purpose of establishing order or punishing a bandit for an
      invasion which it has been declared on the floor of the United States
      Senate was organized and financed by Americans, they see a cleverly
      planned scheme of financiers to force intervention and they know that once
      the army and the flag were in Mexico they would remain permanently. They
      see that unless this is resisted to the death, the ultimate fate of Mexico
      is to be absorbed by the colossus of the North and her independence as a
      nation destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is abundant proof that their fears are well grounded by the record
      of events that have recently occurred in Central America and the West
      Indies. Some years ago Nicaragua borrowed $3,000,000 from J. P. Morgan
      &amp; Co. of New York. A revolution broke out and this was urged as an
      excuse to land the marines from American warships to protect American
      interests. They are still there. America has established a protectorate
      over that country and the present congress has ratified a treaty and
      appropriated $3,000,000 for the exclusive right to the Nicaraguan canal
      route from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and it further stipulates that the
      money shall be used to pay its foreign debt under the advice and
      supervision of the Secretary of Treasury of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an example of what is known as "dollar diplomacy." First get a
      nation into debt and the rest is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      United States troops are also in possession of the Republics of Hayti and
      also of Santo Domingo under precisely similar conditions. The troops were
      landed and took possession of the Custom Houses; in other words, of the
      Nation's finances. Representatives of the United States are at the elbow
      of the native officials, dictating the expenditures and in general telling
      what may and may not be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porto Rico is the absolute property of the United States. Cuba is
      dominated by the American tobacco and sugar trusts and cannot make any
      treaty without the consent of the United States government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Panama Canal strip was seized as the result of a plot formulated in
      Washington and of which President Roosevelt was fully advised&mdash;American
      warships were in the harbor when the so-called revolution was sprung. A
      provisional government was organized and immediately recognized by the
      powers at Washington; a treaty already drawn up was hastily adopted and
      accepted by Washington; the troops were landed and took possession of the
      ten-mile canal strip, and when the navy of Columbia, which consisted of
      one small gunboat, arrived, it was confronted with the American fleet and
      was helpless. All this was done within the space of forty-eight hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this dastardly piece of land piracy was endorsed by all the
      governments of Europe&mdash;Kaiser Wilhelm personally congratulated
      President Roosevelt. Ten million dollars was loaned by J. P. Morgan &amp;
      Co. to the Republic of Panama and the bonds are guaranteed by the United
      States.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1848 the dominant economic class was represented by the slave-owning,
      cotton-growing element in the South. They sent troops to the border of
      Mexico with the sole purpose of fomenting trouble so as to have some valid
      excuse for the invasion of Mexico. They succeeded and took from Mexico
      one-half of her territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dominant economic class today is represented by Banking, Railroad,
      Oil, Mining and other interests and they are playing the same game that
      the exploiters of chattel slaves played in 1848. To prove this is an easy
      matter, all one has to do is to read a few extracts from the current
      press.

      June 24, 1916: INTERVENTION GROWS IN FAVOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members of Congress Fear It Is Inevitable&mdash;Favor Annexing a Part.
    </p>
    <h3>
      * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      It also transpires that many senators and representatives who advocate
      immediate intervention also favor annexing the northern portion of the
      republic as compensation for the cost of the undertaking. . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical expressions of opinion follow:
    </p>
    <p>
      Representative Rainey&mdash;Events of the week seem to make it clear that
      there is no way of escaping intervention in Mexico. We have striven and
      striven to get along with our neighbor, but it seems impossible. We have
      on our southern border the longest boundary in existence between a
      civilized and a semi-civilized nation. To police it properly would require
      over 2,000,000 men. I favor taking over the northern tier of Mexican
      states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Representative Sabath&mdash;I hope it will not be necessary to intervene,
      but if we do and are forced to lose the lives of a number of men, we
      should annex the country either wholly or in part.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <i>SHOULD DO A GOOD JOB.</i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Representative Britten&mdash;If it becomes necessary to go into Mexico, we
      should make a complete job of it by annexing the northern tier of Mexican
      states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Representative Denison&mdash;If it turns out that our troops were treated
      treacherously we should not hesitate to intervene. We should go southward,
      taking the border with us. We should either do this or receive a large
      indemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On June 24, 1916, the Chicago <i>American</i> printed a cartoon that
      pictured in the most brazen way what the capitalists intended to do, and
      followed it later with an editorial from which the following extracts are
      taken:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing worth while will be accomplished by occasional 'punitive
      expeditions.'"...
    </p>
    <p>
      "The way to IMPRESS the Mexicans is to REPRESS the Mexicans. The way to
      begin is to say to them: . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are no longer planning to catch this bandit or that. We are GOING INTO
      MEXICO. And as far as we GO, <i>we'll stay</i>." . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you see an American soldier one hundred feet inside of Mexico, you
      may take it to mean that ONE HUNDRED FEET ARE NO LONGER MEXICAN, BUT
      UNITED STATES.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you make it necessary for our soldiers to go in two hundred MILES, you
      can change your geographies and add two hundred miles to the United
      States.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this way we hope to make you realize that it is not wise to make us go
      in TOO FAR."...
    </p>
    <p>
      "The United States OUGHT to make one single bite of the cherry, go down
      all the way, and civilize everything between the Rio Grande and the Panama
      Canal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The right kind of American enthusiasm will eventually DO THAT."
    </p>
    <p>
      March 24, 1916, Senator James Hamilton Lewis introduced the following
      resolution in the Senate, recounting the fact that Villa, the "bandit,"
      was notoriously receiving support of both munitions and money from
      Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The text of the Lewis "treason" resolution follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Whereas</i>, It is known to the authorities of the United States that
      funds and supplies are being furnished to the force and following of Villa
      in Mexico from foreign countries, and from sources in the United States of
      America, and
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Whereas</i>, Such supplies and sustenance are being delivered for the
      purpose of being used against the soldiers of the United States and to
      oppose the authority of the United States; therefore, be it
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resolved</i>, That those who are furnishing supplies and sustenance to
      the force of Villa for the purpose of opposing the United States are the
      enemies of the United States, and those in the United States who are
      furnishing supplies and sustenance to the said Villa forces, either of
      money or provisions, arms and ammunition, are within the provision of the
      laws of the United States defining treason as giving aid and comfort to
      the enemies of the United States."...
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall push my resolution vigorously," said Mr. Lewis, after the
      splutter of Mexican debate it had caused, died away. "I may call it up
      Saturday. The administration is in possession of means of information as
      to the identity of the persons or corporations who have been assisting
      this murderous Mexican bandit for the sake of filthy money or dirtier
      politics."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The nation would be amazed to learn the names of some of the men of
      national repute who are mixed up in the intrigue against national peace.
      Many of them are noisy champions of the campaign for preparedness."
